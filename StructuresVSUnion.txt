1.	A union is a special data type available in C that allows storing different data types in the same memory location. You can define a 
    union with many members, but only one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of using the same 
    memory location for multiple purposes.

2.	In C, struct and union types cannot have static members. In C++, struct types are allowed to have static members, but union cannot 
    have static members in C++ also.

3.	When we declare a union, memory allocated for the union is equal to memory needed for the largest member of it, and all members share 
    this same memory space.

4.	Array members are deeply copied when a struct variable is assigned to another one.
